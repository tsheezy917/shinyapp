    <h2>TRUEimpact motivation</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p><strong>PIE</strong> (Player impact rating) is an advanced statistic that measures a player&#39;s impact on his team&#39;s productivity.  However, there is no statistic that can provide a more comprehensive view of a player&#39;s impact outside of his teams&#39; context.  That means we have to create one!  </p>

    <h2>What is TRUEimpact?</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>TRUEimpact attempts to quantify a players PIE rating by indexing against other players in the league, not just those on their team.  It does so by:</p>

<ol>
<li>Accounting for the teams winning percentage (regular season). </li>
<li>Accounting for the winning percentage of the team when a player competes in the game (accounting for games missed by the player). </li>
<li>Using the player&#39;s team PIE (similar to individual PIE, it accounts for a teams impact on a game vs their opponent) because every player is helped/hurt by his team.  This controls for that factor by helping those with high individual PIE ratings but the team PIE is low.<br></li>
</ol>

    <h2>The Logic</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Team PIE is highly correlated with winning.  According to stats.nba.com, teams with the highest PIE in any particular game win about 90% of the time.  This is a good measure to augment the individuals PIE.  Afterall, winning is still the most important statistic of all.  The final index is calculated as follows: </p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>PIE_index</strong> = PIE * Team PIE * (PIE/Team PIE) * Team Win% * Player Win% </li>
<li> The player with the highest score then becomes the reference for all other players. The highest rating was <strong>4.9</strong> and was held by Kevin Durant. All other scores are divided by this value.<br></li>
</ol>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>There are lots of arguments regarding who the &quot;best&quot; player is, but the TRUEimpact Index provides a quantitative basis for having that argument.  </p>

<p>Who&#39;s the best player in the NBA?  Let the debate rage on!    </p>
